    <p>JavaScript is what makes web pages dynamic, and interactive.
    JavaScript itself is fairly compact yet very flexible. Developers have written a large variety of tools 
    on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of extra functionality with minimum effort. These include: </p>

    <ul>

    <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) — APIs built into web browsers, 
    providing functionality like dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles, 
    collecting and manipulating a video stream from the user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples. </li>

    <li>Third-party APIs — Allow developers to incorporate functionality in their sites from other content providers, 
    such as Twitter or Facebook. </li>

    <li>Third-party frameworks and libraries — You can apply these to your HTML to allow you to rapidly build up sites and applications. </li>
    </ul>
